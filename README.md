I'm currently learning Python and one of the best ways I’ve found to grow is by building small but meaningful projects. Each line of code I write helps me understand concepts better and see real results.

So far, I’ve created a few beginner-friendly projects:

Tic-Tac-Toe Game – A simple turn-based game to practice logic and conditionals.

Craftsman Cost Calculator – A project to calculate service costs and practice user input and math operations.

Personalized Welcome Program – A small app that greets the user by name to make coding feel more human.

YouTube Channel Creator (Console App) – A mockup app idea simulating channel setup steps.


These projects may be simple, but they represent a big step forward. I'm building my confidence, learning problem-solving, and turning ideas into real tools.
